# efr32fg23_buram_manager
This library provides APIs to manage Backup Retention RAM (BURAM) on the EFR32FG23 microcontroller. BURAM retains data in low-power modes (e.g., EM4). Features include reading/writing uint8, int8, uint16, int16, and uint32 values with offset support for efficient retention register usage.
